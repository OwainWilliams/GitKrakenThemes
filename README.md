# GitKraken Themes

In [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/invite/sbhVeDpR) 8.3.0 you now have the ability to add custom themes to your GUI. 

Here I plan to add some custom themes that I've created for the git client and you're welcome to submit your own custom themes too!

## How to use

- Make sure you are running GitKraken 8.3+
- Download the theme that you wan to use - you just need the `jsonc` file
